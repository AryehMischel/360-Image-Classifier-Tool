# 360 Image Classifier + Viewer

## Overview
This is a web-based tool designed to detect the format of 360-degree images, process them, and display the images along with their detected formats. The tool supports various 360 image formats and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and viewing images.
**[Live Demo](https://universal-360-image-classifier.onrender.com/)**
## Features
- **Format Detection**: Automatically detects the format of uploaded 360-degree images.
- **Image Processing**: Processes the images to ensure they are displayed correctly.
- **Image Display**: Displays the processed images along with their detected formats.
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Easy-to-use drag and drop interface for uploading images.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Supports various 360 image formats including CubeMap, Equirectangular, and more.
- **Limited VR Support**: This does technically support VR, but it was not put together with VR in mind. The broader project that this code was frankensteined from is much better suited for VR and it should be finished by early 2025.

## Supported Formats
- CubeMap
- StripCubeMap
- StereoCubeMap
- Equirectangular (Eqrt)
- StereoEquirectangular (StereoEqrt)
- HorizontalCross
- HorizontalT
- CubeMapFolder (6 seperate images representing sides of a cubemap in the same directory)
